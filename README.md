# Image-Classification
A Computer Vision related task using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification with CIFAR-10 dataset.

The same Image Classification program was run with different changes to know their affects on the accuracy. The results are shown in the graphs

For the first part, we see the affect of batch normalization in image classification on both training and testing accuracies
